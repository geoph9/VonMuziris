# Project VonMuziris

The purpose of the project is to create customized solution for startup, which aggregates people in the jewelry value chain into decentralized marketplace. 
The concrete goal is to make the process of uploading the jewelry sellers information through form templates easier and less time-consuming. 

The combined solution of two neural networks is built for working with images of jewelry and texts, characterizing them. 
The repository files are:

- Model.py - definition of classes for the model.
- Training.py - uploading the data to Pytorch dataset, training/validating the model.
- Preprocessing.py - preprcosseing of data from original resources.
